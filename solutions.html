            <p style="margin: 40px; color: white; font-weight: 200; line-height: 156%; font-size: 18px;">It is important that every user of TikTok is aware of how much time they are spending on platform and what data of theirs may be collected. It is also important that those who inspire to develop the future of technolgoy and digital platofrms understand what companies should be doing to combat these issues.</p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">
                        Take time to research and learn more about how screen time can affect your mental health and producitivty. It is also important for everyone to set boundaries, use your phones built in screen time tools to limit the amount of time you spend online and connect to apps, like TikTok.
                        <br><br>
                        For future platforms or creators, build in more screen time tools to encourage users to take a break. It is important for developers and designers to remeber that behind every username and avatar that their is a real person. Help to encourage that person to take time to reset and step away from the app even for a couple of minutes.

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">
                    Before signing up for the latest app or click “Yes” to all cookies on a website, be aware of what is really being taken from you. If you have an iPhone use the App Privacy Report before downloading to see all the data that will be collected if you accept the conditions. 
                    <br><br>
                    Companies and developers must strive for transparency when it comes to user privacy. The message should also be understandable to everybody - not a legal description that will only confuse users. Companies should, similar to what Apple is enforcing, allow users at any time to stop the data collection. It is vital that at any point a user can take back and control their personal information.
