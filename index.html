                <p>TikTok has a strong community for any group whether you are interested in sports, dance, politics, comedy- you name it, there's a community. Algorithms customize each user's “For You” page to generate content that they will love and engage with, seamlessly turning their “Fou You” page into a community. The app has changed the way people consume content and interact with their favorite creators, because of this, competitor companies, such as YouTube and Instagram, have rapidly pushed out new features to their apps to allow users to create and view short form content. TikTok in its short history has transformed the way companies, creators, and users use social media and through its software has made numerous technological advancements.</p>

                        -At the heart of TikTok are a series of algorithms that are able to curate a user's “For You” page to show them content they will enjoy.
                        <br><br>
                        -TikTok can tell what content users are enjoying based on playthrough time (amount of time spent watching) and whether they like or comment. 
                        <br><br>
                        -This combination allows the algorithm to determine whether or not the user should be served similar content in the future to the one they just watched.

                    <p>
                        -Upon opening the app, users are instantly shown a video and as soon as a user wants a new one all they have to do is swipe up. Once they swipe, they are shown a new video roughly around 30-60 seconds long.
                        <br><br>
                        -People have switched to TikTok because they would rather have the ability to watch numerous short form videos instead of a longer video.
                        <br><br>
                        -Technology and social media apps, like TikTok, have helped younger generations have shorter attention spans and TikTok plays right into those short attention spans by making their content quick to view.
