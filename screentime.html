Screen time in children and young adults has always been a concern and as caution raises about the effect it has on learning and youth development, phone companies have also taken action.</p>

                            A large portion of time spent scrolling on the apps will start to result in becoming distracted from daily activities and turning to the app to escape work. When people want to put off their work or are bored they often will pick up their phone and check their notifications or go to their favorite app. 
                            <br><br>
                            Out of the group of high schoolers who took the survey, 92.3% said if they were bored they would often head straight to TikTok.
