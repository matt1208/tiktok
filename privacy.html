TikTok uses the data it collects to help serve advertisements that best suit the user. Most people always wonder how they are shown ads that are perfectly aligned to what they are looking for or may want to see. The reason for the phenomenon is the data that each service gathers from you and the profile it is able to build to best service the person.</p>

            <h2>A Move Towards Transparency</h2>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">In April 2021, Apple launched their App Tracking Transparency feature which required companies to announce if their product tracked users and ask for users permission. TikTok adapted to the new changes and stated online, “TikTok will show Apple’s tracking permission prompt to support the needs of our brand and partners while respecting our users’ privacy choices” (“Supporting our partners through IOS 14 and beyond: Tiktok for business blog”).</p>

            <h2>Data & Engagement</h2>
            <p id="subheaderStats">TikTok’s data collection is helping to keep users engaged on their platform and has become part of the new normal surrounding digital technologies. Every time a user opens TikTok they are bound to see an advertisement that they relate to but what is unique to TikTok is how the app displays ads.</p>

                            TikTok advertisements are placed in a user's feed just like another piece of content from their favorite creator, a quick video from a company seeking engagement.

                            If a user doesn’t want to watch or engage, they simply swipe and they are taken to the next piece of content.
